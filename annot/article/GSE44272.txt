"This was a multi-institutional retrospective study. Investigators searched their local databases to find patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer who were long-term survivors. Participants had to fulfil all the following criteria: a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer; HER2 positive disease, as determined 3+ by immunohistochemistry or positive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH); treatment with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab; stable disease or a sustained partial or complete response lasting at least 3 years; and availability of clinical data and tumour FFPE block." (Gámez-Pozo et al 2014:2)

"Treatment with anti-HER2 therapy other than trastuzumab was not allowed." (Gámez-Pozo et al 2014:2)

"A control group was also created with patients who had had a progression within the first 12 months of first-line trastuzumab-based therapy: molecular analysis was also performed in samples from this control group (poor-response group, hereafter)." (Gámez-Pozo et al 2014:2)

"Hybridization, washing, staining and scanning of Affymetrix Human Genome U219 arrays were performed following the manufacturer's recommendations. Scanned images (DAT files) were transformed into intensities (CEL files) by GCOS (Affymetrix). The raw intensity values were background corrected, log2 transformed, quartile normalized and summarized using the RMA algorithm in Genomics Suite 6.6 (Partek). Microarray data and clinical info are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE44272)." (Gámez-Pozo et al 2014:2)

"HER2 status had been determined by immunohistochemistry in 98% of cases and by FISH in 21%. At the time of initial diagnosis, 21% of patients had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 70% had received adjuvant chemotherapy. In all but 11 patients, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy was anthracycline-based. Twenty-eight percent of patients had received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Four patients (8%) had been treated with adjuvant trastuzumab. Table 1 summarises clinical features." (Gámez-Pozo et al 2014:3)

"In patients with complete response, median duration of response was 62 months (35-127) and the median overall survival 67 months (36-130). In the control group, median duration of response was 6 months (2- 12) and the median overall survival 33 months (15-124). Sixty-one FFPE samples with annotated clinical information were selected, 53 of which had enough RNA to perform hybridization. Among these 53 samples, 35 samples corresponded to long-term responders and 18 to the control group." (Gámez-Pozo et al 2014:4)
